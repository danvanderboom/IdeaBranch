## 1. Implementation
- [x] 1.1 Scaffold OpenSpec change dir with proposal/tasks and UI/Analytics deltas
- [x] 1.2 Define precision-aware timeline event model in shared project (TemporalPrecision, TemporalInstant, TemporalRange)
- [x] 1.3 Add SkiaSharp.Views.Maui package to IdeaBranch.App and initialize handlers in MauiProgram
- [x] 1.4 Create SkiaTimelineView control inheriting SKCanvasView with draw loop and coordinate transforms
- [x] 1.5 Implement zoom/pan gestures (pinch, wheel, drag) with inertia and bounds clamping
- [x] 1.6 Implement precision-aware layout (year/month/day) with tick/grid generation
- [x] 1.7 Implement event marker rendering sized/colored by type with legend display
- [x] 1.8 Implement hit-testing for event selection and details navigation
- [x] 1.9 Implement drag-to-select brush for range filtering with SelectedTimeRange binding
- [x] 1.10 Implement pixel-density clustering that expands progressively on zoom
- [x] 1.11 Add viewport culling/virtualization to sustain FPS with 50k+ events
- [x] 1.12 Replace static list with Skia control in TimelinePage.xaml and wire to ViewModel
- [x] 1.13 Add FPS/memory telemetry and diagnostics toggles (optional debug overlay)
- [x] 1.14 Add unit tests for layout/clustering algorithms
  - ✅ TemporalInstantTests (13 tests): normalization, constructors, leap year, boundaries, equality
  - ✅ TemporalRangeTests (18 tests): factory methods, DateTime overloads, validation, edge cases
  - ✅ TimelineEventViewTests (12 tests): domain conversion, null handling, tags, equality
  - ✅ TimelineRendererTests (11 tests): clustering, visible filtering, boundary conditions
  - ✅ Total: 52 timeline tests (all passing)
- [x] 1.15 Validate OpenSpec change with `openspec validate add-interactive-skiasharp-timeline --strict`
