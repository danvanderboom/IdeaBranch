## Why
The UI spec currently only mentions that Map and Timeline views exist for navigation, but the product documentation describes extensive functionality for these views including geospatial visualization, temporal visualization, filtering, and integration with topic nodes and annotations. These capabilities need to be fully specified.

## What Changes
- Expand `ui` spec with ADDED requirements for Map view functionality
- Expand `ui` spec with ADDED requirements for Timeline view functionality
- Specify geospatial annotation display on Map view
- Specify temporal annotation display on Timeline view
- Specify filtering capabilities for both views
- Specify integration with topic node selection
- Specify multiple layers and visualizations

## Impact
- Affected specs: ui (ADDED requirements for Map and Timeline functionality)
- Affected code: Map and Timeline views (currently placeholder implementations - this is spec-only)
