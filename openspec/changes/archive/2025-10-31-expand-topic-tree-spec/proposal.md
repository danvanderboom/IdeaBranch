## Why
The product spec currently only specifies basic hierarchical organization and list-to-child-node conversion. The product documentation describes additional topic tree features including node manipulation, document import, and enhanced context for LLM requests that need to be specified.

## What Changes
- Expand `product` spec with MODIFIED requirements
- Add requirements for node manipulation (add, move, reorder, delete)
- Add requirements for document import (Arxiv.org integration)
- Add requirements for enhanced context in LLM requests (path to root)
- Add additional scenarios for existing requirements

## Impact
- Affected specs: product (MODIFIED requirements)
- Affected code: None (spec-only change - implementation will follow in future changes)
