## Why
Ensure the analytics timeline explicitly reuses the shared SkiaSharp renderer to guarantee interaction and performance parity.

## What Changes
- Add analytics spec delta stating reuse of `SkiaTimelineView` renderer and interactions
- No code changes expected (already implemented)

## Impact
- Affected specs: `analytics`
- Affected code: `src/IdeaBranch.App/Views/TimelinePage.xaml` (already uses `SkiaTimelineView`)

## References
- Implementation view: `src/IdeaBranch.App/Views/TimelinePage.xaml` (uses `controls:SkiaTimelineView` bound to `TimelineEventViews`)
- Interactive control: `src/IdeaBranch.App/Controls/SkiaTimelineView.xaml.cs` (SkiaSharp-based timeline with zoom, pan, selection, clustering)
- Renderer logic: `src/IdeaBranch.App/Controls/TimelineRenderer.cs`
- Analytics usage docs: `docs/development/analytics.md`
