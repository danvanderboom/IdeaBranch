# analytics Specification

## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change add-analytics. Update Purpose after archive.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Word cloud generation
The system SHALL allow users to generate word clouds from prompts and responses in conversations.

#### Scenario: Generate word cloud from conversation thread prompts
- **WHEN** a user requests a word cloud for prompts in a conversation thread
- **THEN** the system generates a word cloud showing the most frequent words from all prompts in the thread

#### Scenario: Generate word cloud from conversation thread responses
- **WHEN** a user requests a word cloud for responses in a conversation thread
- **THEN** the system generates a word cloud showing the most frequent words from all responses in the thread

#### Scenario: Generate word cloud from multiple conversations
- **WHEN** a user requests a word cloud from multiple conversations
- **THEN** the system generates a word cloud aggregating words from all selected conversations

#### Scenario: Generate word cloud from user's conversations
- **WHEN** a user requests a word cloud from all their conversations
- **THEN** the system generates a word cloud from all prompts or responses across the user's conversations

#### Scenario: Generate word cloud from team's conversations
- **WHEN** a user requests a word cloud from all team conversations
- **THEN** the system generates a word cloud from all prompts or responses across the team's conversations

### Requirement: Word cloud filtering
The system SHALL allow users to filter word cloud content using tag-based query filters.

#### Scenario: Filter word cloud by tags
- **WHEN** a user applies tag filters to word cloud generation
- **THEN** only text from annotations or nodes matching the tag filters is included in the word cloud

#### Scenario: Hierarchical tag filtering for word clouds
- **WHEN** a user applies hierarchical tag filters to word cloud generation
- **THEN** text from nodes matching the tag hierarchy is included
- **AND** users can control the layers or levels of detail displayed

### Requirement: Timeline visualization
The system SHALL provide timeline visualization capabilities for organizing and visualizing sequences of events within a topic (distinct from the Timeline view).

#### Scenario: Create timeline visualization
- **WHEN** a user creates a timeline visualization for a topic
- **THEN** events and temporal data are displayed chronologically
- **AND** the timeline provides a high-level overview of historical development

#### Scenario: Timeline visualization updates dynamically
- **WHEN** temporal data is added to nodes in a timeline visualization
- **THEN** the timeline automatically updates to include new information
- **AND** the timeline remains current and accurate

### Requirement: Hierarchical tag-based filtering
The system SHALL allow users to apply precise and flexible filters using hierarchical tags to control displayed detail levels.

#### Scenario: Filter by hierarchical tags
- **WHEN** a user applies hierarchical tag filters
- **THEN** only data matching the tag hierarchy is displayed
- **AND** users can apply filters at different levels of granularity

#### Scenario: Broad tag filtering
- **WHEN** a user applies a high-level tag filter
- **THEN** data matching the tag and all child tags is displayed
- **AND** a broad view of the data is shown

#### Scenario: Fine-grained tag filtering
- **WHEN** a user applies a specific subtag filter
- **THEN** only data matching the specific subtag is displayed
- **AND** a focused, detailed view of the data is shown

### Requirement: Customizable data filtering
The system SHALL allow users to apply either broad or fine-grained filters to their data depending on research objectives.

#### Scenario: Switch between broad and fine-grained filters
- **WHEN** a user switches between broad and fine-grained tag filters
- **THEN** the view adjusts accordingly
- **AND** users can quickly switch between high-level overviews and in-depth analyses

#### Scenario: Combine multiple filters
- **WHEN** a user combines multiple filter criteria
- **THEN** only data matching all criteria is displayed
- **AND** the combined filters are visually indicated

### Requirement: Data export for analysis
The system SHALL allow users to export filtered and analyzed data for external analysis.

#### Scenario: Export filtered data
- **WHEN** a user exports data after applying filters
- **THEN** only the filtered data is exported
- **AND** the export format preserves the applied filters

#### Scenario: Export analysis results
- **WHEN** a user exports analysis results (e.g., word cloud data, timeline data)
- **THEN** the exported data is formatted appropriately for external analysis tools
