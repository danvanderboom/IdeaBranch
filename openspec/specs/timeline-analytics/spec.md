# timeline-analytics Specification

## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change add-visualization-export-svg-png. Update Purpose after archive.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Analytics Timeline event connections
The system SHALL display connections between related events on the Analytics Timeline visualization.

- Connections SHALL be displayed as lines linking events that are related (e.g., cause-effect, sequence, semantic relationships, or shared annotations/nodes).
- Connections SHALL be visible within type bands and across type bands when event grouping by type is enabled.
- Users SHALL be able to toggle connections visibility on and off independently of event grouping.
- Connection rendering SHALL use routing algorithms to minimize overlaps and visual clutter (orthogonal or curved paths).
- Connection lines SHALL be styled with colors, line weights, and styles to indicate relationship types if applicable.
- A legend SHALL indicate connection styles and relationship types if multiple types are supported.
- Connections SHALL respect active filters and only show connections between currently visible events.
